# Blitzkrieg Tracker

This mod makes using the Blitzkrieg tactic easier and automates working with progress tables. Instead of manually checking boxes, your progress is tracked directly during gameplay.

## Key Features

- **Table generation on the website** — Blitzkrieg stages are created automatically based on your start positions.
- **Automatic checkbox completion** — the mod records your progress and marks it in the table.
- **Import & Export** — seamlessly transfer profiles between the website and the mod.
- **Notifications** — get notified when you complete a new progress milestone.

## Who Is This For

- Players using Blitzkrieg to improve consistency
- Those who want structured practice and progress tracking

## How It Works

2. The website generates a Blitzkrieg stage table.
3. Export the profile and connect it to the mod.
4. As you play, the mod automatically checks off progress in the table.
